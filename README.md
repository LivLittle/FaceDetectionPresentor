# FaceDetectionPresentor
Real time face detection using Pyhton 3 and OpenCV library of Haar Cascades to run presentation.

The first file searches for real time faces using a picamera and raspberry pi. If face is found, a green box will be placed around the face, and a presentation file will open. Once closed, the camera will then search for faces until another face is found and will open the next presentation. The will continue until there are no more presentations. 

The second file just simply runs the picamera in search of real time faces. If a face is found, a green box will be placed around the face.
